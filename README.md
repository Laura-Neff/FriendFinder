# FriendFinder

A web app coded in JavaScript and reliant on web servers that takes user input to match with a friend from given API data. Program is designated in 
4 segments -- a friends.js file that holds the data of all possible matches, the home and survey pages themselves that incorporate some JQuery and AJAX calls
so that the user's data will be posted to the API, a htmlRoutes.js file to direct routing between websites, an apiRoutes.js file to dictate the processes
of how to choose a match for a user, and a server.js file that acts as the web server to listen to the port so that events can happen.
